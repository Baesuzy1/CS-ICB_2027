# ANTIKYTHERA MECHANISM - Scientific Calculator

A modern, Swing-based scientific calculator written in Java. This GUI application supports basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, square roots, logarithms, square powers, and even symbolic operations like derivatives and integration (numerically).

## ‚ú® Features

- Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan` (in degrees)
- Logarithmic function: `ln`
- Square root: `‚àö`
- Square: `x¬≤`
- Numerical Derivative (`d/dx`) for sin(x)
- Numerical Integration (`‚à´`) for sin(x)
- Clean UI using Java Swing
- Expression evaluation using JavaScript engine
